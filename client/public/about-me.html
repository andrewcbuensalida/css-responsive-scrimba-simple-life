				<h2>
					My name is Andrew and living the flexible life is awesome.
				</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>I used to be a unflexible</strong>. I couldn't even
					touch my toes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Things were terrible. My back would hunch, my neck would
					strain, I couldn't scratch my back.
				</p>

				<h3>How I turned things around</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>I was on the verge of inflexibility</strong>. I
					literally put 110% of my effort into stretching.
				</p>
				<p>
					It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was starting
					to get easier to reach, and before you know it, it worked.
				</p>

				<h3>Now I live the flexible life</h3>
				<p>
					Now that I'm living a flexible life, things are so much
					better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I
					have more free time to enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
					With how much it turned my life around,
					<strong
						>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
						did it</strong
					>, and how others can benefit from living a flexibly life as
					well, which is why I started this site!
